# BoardGameAI
Project developing AI agents for 3 board games of increasing difficulty:
1. Tic-Tac-Toe
2. Connect 4
3. Checkers
   
Each agent is trained via reinforcement learning using the Actor-Critic algorithm, combined with Monte-Carlo-Tree Search.

## Games 
The games themselves, which also function as reinforcement learning training environments, were implemented using [PyGame](https://github.com/pygame)
